# 2077 Collective: Making Ethereum Cool Again!

We’re beyond thrilled to announce the official launch of 2077 Collective, a community-centric initiative designed to “make Ethereum cool again.” June marked a significant journey as we progressed from ideation and rough planning to fundraising and finally execution. Over the past few weeks, our dedicated team has worked tirelessly to ensure a successful launch. Today, we’re excited to share with you all what 2077 Collective is.

## How it started:

Like every other effective solution, it begins with identifying the problem, and one of Ethereum’s pressing issues is marketing. Emmanuel Awosika, Founder and Chief Research Nerd at 2077 Collective understands this and has openly discussed Ethereum's marketing shortcomings on Crypto Twitter (CT).

While Ethereum blockchain boasts of builders and developers building innovative infrastructures, there’s an obvious lack of effective marketing, sadly. A candid survey about Ethereum often yields responses like “too technical,” “it’s a blockchain for the OGs,” and “too expensive.” There is hardly any effort to show the world the amazing capabilities of the blockchain or how users can interact with it and this has left Ethereum with an infamous description: high gas fees.

The realization that something needs to be done led to the rebranding of Ethereum2077 (our research publication) into 2077 Collective.

Like a thesis waiting to be proven true, the above tweet was a confirmation of people’s awareness of Ethereum’s marketing problems and the lack of a unified front to foster this promotion. The tweet led to a flood of DMs from like-minded people who shared the same understanding and from contributors who were ready to pool their skills to accelerate Ethereum adoption via 2077 Collective. This begs the question “What is 2077 Collective?”


## What is 2077 Collective?

2077 Collective is a marketing/creative studio, a research shop, and a mad science lab rolled into one. It is a league of creatives, researchers, marketers, and developers who come together to contribute, build, research, write, and create in a way that provides value to the Ethereum ecosystem. 2077 Collective aims to fill the narrative gap and solve Ethereum’s marketing problem.


## Core Services:

Research: With a close-knit team of highly skilled researchers with proven track records, 2077 Collective, through our research service, collaborates with solid Ethereum-based projects to create in-depth reports on their tech. We write deep dives and technical analyses on Ethereum-based protocols, infrastructures, and applications.
Marketing: We will partner with projects to help grow their marketing efforts and promote their products in a way that adds value to the ecosystem.
Creative contests: 2077 Collective will act as a platform that facilitates creative contests and bounties, allowing community members to contribute their skills to the ecosystem through creative contests. We aim to be the link between projects looking to sponsor bounties and individuals looking to participate.

## EIP Wiki:

The [EIP Wiki](https://eips.wiki) is a “library” by 2077 Collective where users can get quality research articles about Ethereum Improvement Proposals. This initiative which started as the “EIPs for Nerds” series on our Substack page, has grown to become an all-in-one information page to learn about EIPs that affect the Ethereum infrastructure layer, execution & consensus layer, and application layer. This is a valuable page for research nerds within the industry.

## 2077 Research:

[2077 Research](https://research.2077.xyz) is the Collective’s research arm that forms partnerships with projects within the Ethereum ecosystem to carry out deep dives into their tech, and unique propositions, and explain to users how they can be leveraged. With a diverse audience of researchers, C-level executives, developers, and academics, these research reports will act as valuable resources for all.

## Etherpedia:

[Etherpedia](https://etherpedia.2077.xyz) is a website that contains a guide to all things Ethereum for all levels of expertise.

## EIP-2077:

Branded as Ethereum’s unofficial marketing department, [EIP-2077](https://eip2077.info) is a community-driven initiative that aims to strengthen Ethereum’s branding beyond what it is currently known for and onboard new users and developers.
